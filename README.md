Features

This is a complete rewrite of a project I did in bootcamp. If you are interested in seeing the orginal project, it can be found on the branch `original-project` and is deployed [here](https://original-project--romantic-kilby-330ce7.netlify.app/). No matter how naive you may find the rewrite, I'm certain if you view the orginal project, you'll be forced to admit this rewrite demonstrates measurable growth.

This version of the app means to take a serverless approach and make use of the infrastructure and tools available through Netlify.

Lastly, this project serves no purpose other than allowing me a space to continue to grow. It is, at it's core, a TODO app. It doesn't add to the world, it won't be beautiful (unless you are a designer who would like to provide me with some design files, in which case, by all means, reach out ðŸ˜Œ).
